 Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace 
 or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted
  by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.
  
# this is the first comment
spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
          # ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
